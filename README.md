# Face Greases
Application for browsing makeup products. It presents, filters and sorts them.

You can view an already deployed application [here](https://face-greases.herokuapp.com).

Makeup products data comes from free [Makeup API](http://makeup-api.herokuapp.com/).

### Setup
You can run application in two ways:
1. by running main method in MakeupStoreApplication.java in your IDE,
2. by running command 'bootRun' on a 'gradlew.bat' file on Windows or running './gradlew bootRun' on Linux and MacOS in application's main directory.

Application needs Java to run. I use Java 11 and this is the version I recommend.

### How to 
These are all views that make up the application:
- Home ([localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080/)) - home page with some information about project and contact links,
- Shop ([localhost:8080/shop](http://localhost:8080/shop)) - In this view you can filter and sort makeup products,
- Detailed product view ([localhost:8080/shop/{id}](http://localhost:8080/shop/1)) - this view presents details about one product.

You can also change the language of the application interface by choosing desired language from the list in the top right corner of the page.

If you encounter any problem I'm more than happy to contact you on this.

Thank you for your time to read this! Hope the code is clear and simple to you!
